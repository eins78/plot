Release pipeline cleanups:

- **CHANGELOG.md**: rename `## 1.0.0` heading to `## 1.0.0 — Initial release (pre-changeset history)` to prevent a duplicate heading when changesets generates the real `## 1.0.0` stable-release entry in the future.
- **ralph-plot-sprint version drift**: bump `skills/ralph-plot-sprint/SKILL.md` from `1.0.0-beta.2` → `1.0.0-beta.3` to align with the rest of the skill versions (pre-existing drift; no content change).
- **RELEASING.md**: create release guide with a `## Downstream: plot-marketplace` section documenting the manual post-release step and open questions for the maintainer.
